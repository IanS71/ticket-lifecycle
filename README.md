This is the beginning of what accessing the End Users page looks like, options are continue as a guest or login if you normally create tickets regularly. For this portion of the lab, i'll be creating 3 labs with varying SLA level and problems. The one i'll be focusing on is our SEV-A case, Mobile Banking Disruption.

I've submitted the other tickets Accounting team needs adobe upgrades and Accounting team's tablets running slow. Although those are SEV-B, the natural order and time allotment for SEV-A is a lot more strict so i'll open it.

As a level I support, I don't have the resources to deal with an issue as critical as Mobile Banking. I transfer the ticket to System Adminstrator Marlon Robinson, and notify the recipient that a fix is still being looked into. I will login into Marlon's account to handle the ticket transfer

Marlon Robinson was able to find the solution "Found the issue with the Load Balancer and has reset it" and now will mark the ticket as resolved
